        <h2>Healthcare Community Opportunities</h2>

        <p>
          Online health communities, such as health support groups on Facebook and Reddit, and earlier on dedicated forums, have been a part of the internet for a long time. Recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, their impact has been brought into the spotlight.

          Nowadays, it is common for people to research illness symptoms that they experience on the internet in an effort to become as knowledgeable as possible. There are two key ways in which people conduct this research, some will look for information on an official website, such as PatientsLikeMe or the Mayo Clinic, others may turn to social media groups and forums. "PatientsLikeMe is an extensive website that provides its over 600,000 users with a place where people can share their health data to track their progress and help others." (Fox, 2014)

          These communities can often be beneficial, helping some users to find a sense of community and hope. This was shown in a study on illness communities on a website called Patients Like Me, where 57% of users considered the communities helpful for learning about side effects and treatments and 72% of people rated the site as somewhat helpful for learning about symptoms. This also showed 42% of people in their groups were able to locate others with the same conditions, and were able to receive assistance and understanding from discussing their experiences (Fox, 2014).

          A more generalized study on patients with chronic illnesses found that people with unusual conditions can struggle with finding appropriate care from their physicians who lack knowledge of their uncommon disease and can find useful information, coping mechanisms, and moral support through online communities. This study focused on patients with EDS, a rare inherited condition that affects connective tissue. During their research they figured out their healthcare providers had not given a correct diagnosis or treatment plan. The patients also found that they had been given a lack of informative information to help at home and in their everyday lives.  During this study, the researchers found that the patients had gone to support groups found on social media sites such as Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, and Instagram. This self-directed research helped the patients in this study to understand their illness better and find good ways to relieve their symptoms including chronic pain. Their better understanding allowed them to have more in-depth conversations with their healthcare providers and in some cases find a correct diagnosis (Ashtari, 2022).

          In an article written by Fox (2014) they talk about a debate about if people should be talking about their medical experience with some saying if people should be talking about their medical experience. The Pew research Center has been studying the life of health information online for the past 23 years as of 2023. Pew Research found that in their last national survey in the United States of America, 72% of adult internet users had looked online for information about an extensive range of health issues, 26% of adult internet users say that had read about other experiences related to health and medical issues in the past year, and 16% of adult internet users in the USA have gone online in the past year to find others with the same health conditions as them to share and communicate with others in the same situation.
