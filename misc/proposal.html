			<h3>Project Technology/Topic Proposal</h3>

			<p>Due Date:  Friday 12th May with presentation on Tuesday 9th.</p>
			<p>Team name: <em>Two plus One equals Two</em></p>


			<p>Team Coordinator/Leader: <em>Skye Pooley</em></p>

			<!-- Topic name -->

			<p><b>Topic Name: </b><em>Benefits and Risks of Participation in Online Helthcare Forums</em></p>



			<h3>Topic Justification</h3>

			<p>
				Online health forums and communities have been a part of the internet for a long time. Recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, their impact has been brought into the spotlight. <br>
				These communities can often be beneficial, helping some users to find a sense of community and hope. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The use of these forums does come with some risks, however. These forums are used by millions of users from around the world, all able to contribute with few restrictions. 
				This can and has led to the spread of misinformation and advice from users who may be unqualified in the relevant health fields. 
				Misinformation especially on the topic of health and wellbeing could have detrimental effects on a user who may choose to follow such advice.
			</p>
			<p>
				We believe it is important to weigh the benefits and risks of such platforms and investigate ways in which they could see improvement.
