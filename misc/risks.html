        <h2>Healthcare Community Risks</h2>

        <p>
          The prevelance of online communites in todays age is not without risk, evenmore so in healthcare communities. When looking at the risks posed in online health communites, key themes can be identified. 
        </p>

        <h4>Misleading Information</h4>

        <p>
          These health communites are made up of users sharing their personal experiences, and advice. Whilst some of this may be valuable, they can also be misleading especially where discussions dominated by a small number of “unrepresentative patient stories”.(Ziebland et al. 2012) “The powerful and memorable delivery of a personal experience could be sed for a deliberately misleading or exploitative message”(Ziebland et al. 2012) which can lead to the spread of information not backed by scientific evidence and where users may solely rely on such information leading to them making uninformed decisions regarding their health. There are multiple views on why people a susceptible to misinformation. One viewpoint is that of deficit hypothesis where “...people who believe misinformation do not have sufficient knowledge or literacy to discriminate between true and false information.” Literacy in this case isn’t limited to just being able to read and write but can include things like digital and science literacy where which can affect older and younger people respectively. Another viewpoint is that “people tend to be susceptible to misinformation that is consistent with their preexisting beliefs or worldview.” (Scherer, L. et al 2021) This effect was seen with many religious and or conservative individuals being against vaccines and even protesting against world governements.
        </p>

        <h4>Exploitative Messaging</h4>

        <p>
          Following from the previous point, the persuasiveness of personal experiences shared in online health communites can be exploited for deliberate misinformation. Individuals with ulterior motives can use these communities to exploit users via misinformation to push a product or service. “Vocal commentators or partisan media often selectively cite individual dissenting voices as the ultimate authorities on the topic in question.”(de Regt et al. 2020) Often these individuals or groups spread “fake news and pseudo-facts through funding research that could provide results that oppose the scientific consensus.”(de Regt et al. 2020) Often people of power such as politicans use social platforms to validate the views of those misinformed and exploit it for personal gain such as winning office or pushing a product of a company they may have a vested interest in. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The omitting of facts is a strategy used by businesses to be able to sell an alternative product that would fix health issues where there are already better ways to do so. A way contemporary information is dismissed “...to label it as a conspiracy theory, followed by the marginalization and denigration of established experts and researchers who produced the evidence in the first place.”(de Regt et al. 2020) By questioning the motivations of experts, the sow the seeds of discontent among the susceptible populace which buys in to their reasoning and product. The use of health communites helps propagate their product to many users which in tow will recommend them to friends and family essentialy giving the business free publicity.
        </p>

        <h4>Platforms</h4>

        <p>
          These can healthcare communities can be seen on multiple platforms on the web ranging from blog style medias such as Twitter and Facebook to chat based platforms such as WhatApp. “Some of these platforms appear to be more permeable to misinformation than others.”(Swire-Thompson, B., Lazer, B., 2020) Misinformation can spread in different ways depending on the framework of these platforms. Twitter for example gas a framework where users can post content which can be reshared which can lead to misleading information being shared via 3rd party sites propagating the information further, and replied to which creates an echo chamber effect where like minded individuals or those who share the same view reinforce each others viewpoint. WhatsApp however works with groupchats, though harder to find due to needing to be invited into a group, once invited the user is exposed to a wave of potential misinformation and a plethora of sources of this misinformation including but not limited to other groups, hidden sites and other platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although the prevalence of online communites as risen in recent years especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, experts still have little knowledge on the severity of the issue due to a lack of data accessible by researchers. More work needs to be done on assessing the true dangers of such platforms in terms of health misinformation. A small study on Pinterest showed “800 vaccine-related Pinterest posts and found that 74% were antivaccine in sentiment.”(Swire-Thompson, B., Lazer, B., 2020) This was only a small sample but the numbers show that misinformation on these platforms could be dangerous in the near future not only in terms of healthcare but other issues that will continue to plague us such as climate change.
        </p>

        <p>
          Online communites can be a benefit to many users but the risks associated cannot be ignored. While there is no strong regulation on the content that can be posted on these platforms, the information discussed can be at best disingenuous or at worst dangerous and fatal. Misinformation can spread in these communites from already misinformed individuals, exploitative business and peoples of power and by political entities. Whilst companies such as Meta are starting to self regulate their platforms, there are other platforms that pride themselves on a lack of regulation. With more mainstream platforms starting to regulate, misinformation may start to thrive in these less regualted communities and so we may need to see governments look to set up universal standards to how sensitive information such as healthcare is discussed in the digital sphere.
