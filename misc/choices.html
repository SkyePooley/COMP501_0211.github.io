        <h2>Technology Choices</h2>

        <p>As we have seen in our research into the opportunities and risks posed by online health communities of care, there are significant benefits to the existence of, and participation in these communities. It is important for people to be able to share experiences with each other to find community and good advice. However, the potential for spread of misleading or false information through said communities can cause harm to participants and the people around them.</p>

        <p>As we look to the future and prepare for other disease outbreaks, we need to consider ways in which we can reduce this harm. One method which has seen widespread use on twitter is labelling posts which contain information which has been proven to be false. (Twitter, n.d.) This is a good step and may prevent well meaning users from believing or sharing these posts. However, amongst those who already hold strong, false beliefs relating to healthcare, these tags may be ignored as these people view the government and corporate media as corrupt and untrustworthy. (Telltale Research, 2021)</p>

        <p>It's important to consider that although content feed algorithms utilised by social media platforms do have an effect on what content users see from their groups and friends, the choices of individuals in what they read and share has a much more substantial effect on the diversity of opinions that users interact with. (Robertson, 2015) A 2015 study written by Eytan Bakshy, Solomon Messing, and Lada A. Adamic investigated how much conservative aligned content that liberal aligned users were exposed to and interacted with, the researchers referred to this as “cross cutting content.” Their study found a significant difference in the amount of cross cutting content a user would be exposed to if content was selected randomly compared to what content is available to be shown from the user’s network of friends and groups. For liberal aligned users the amount of cross cutting content exposure drops from approximately 45% with random selection, to 24% when selected from content shared by friends and groups. The researchers noted a much smaller reduction in the proportion of cross cutting content users were exposed to between the content available from their network and what Facebook showed them, an only 1% difference. (Bakshy, Messing, & Adamic, 2015)
        </p>
        <p>This study showed that the types of content users are exposed to is more closely related to the groups that they choose to participate in than the goals of the content delivery algorithm. This shows that the creation of echo chambers and the spread of misinformation on Facebook cannot be directly attributed to the content delivery algorithm and places responsibility on users to write factual posts and carefully select which communities they choose to participate in. 
        </p>

        <p>Another method currently being used to reduce the spread of harmful misinformation and other forms of objectionable content is Reddit’s subreddit quarantine policy. Reddit is a slightly unusual social media site in that it consists of many smally communities known as “subreddits” which focus on a specific topic, for example r/art which allows its members to share and discuss their original artworks. (Reddit, 2023) Each of these subreddits are managed by a small group of their members who are responsible for ensuring that posts on the subreddit conform to both Reddit’s site-wide rules, and the subreddit rules which the moderators themselves put in place. (Reddit, 2022)</p>

        <p>When subreddit moderators do their jobs well, this system allows for a diverse range of communities to remain safe and civil without Reddit needing to invest heavily in content moderators to ensure content conforms to site-wide rules. However, in subreddits where the moderation team is inactive, or is actively promoting content which breaks site rules, Reddit may step in and either remove or “quarantine” the subreddit in an effort to reduce the harm being caused in and by these communities. When a subreddit is quarantined “[attempting to access the community] will display a warning that requires users to explicitly opt-in to viewing the content. They generate no revenue, do not appear in non-subscription-based feeds (eg Popular), and are not included in search or recommendations.” (Reddit, 2021) These measures ensure that only users who are already aware of the potentially upsetting or harmful content on a quarantined subreddit are able to view it, and that in the most extreme cases, the communities are completely removed from Reddit. A 2022 study on Reddit moderation found that subreddit quarantines were achieving their goal of reducing new members to subreddits, and in some cases, reducing the activity levels of members. The study found a 79.5% reduction in new users joining the quarantined subreddit “r/theredpill” and a 52.4% reduction in activity withing the subreddit after the quarantine was put in place. (Chandrasekharan, Jhaver, Bruckman, & Gilbert, 2022) In this same study, the authors note that this approach has advantages over outright bans for a website such as Reddit which does not want to be seen as stifling their users ability to discuss sensitive issues.</p>
